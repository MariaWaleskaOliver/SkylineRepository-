##  Welcome to my Repository!

I am a Computer Programming student in my second year at Conestoga College. I learned that you have a position open for a Marketing Assistant Student, and I would like to show some of my work in class with hopes of being considered as a candidate.    

### BEAUTÉ

I made a static website for jewelry called Beuté using HTML and CSS. That was one of the most important and pleasurable assignments for me. Please check it out! [BEAUTÉ Web site ](https://mariawaleskaoliver.github.io/skyline/)
